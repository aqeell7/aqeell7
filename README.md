### Aqeel Ahmed
**Full Stack Developer**

Mechanical Engineering graduate who transitioned into software development.

**My Philosophy:**
I am driven by the **"Why."** I don't just write code that works; I dig deep to understand the underlying logic and system architecture. I am not attached to a specific tech stack—I treat languages and frameworks as tools to solve problems. Whether it's the MERN stack today or Rust tomorrow, I enjoy the process of deconstructing complex concepts and rebuilding them.

---

**🛠️ Technical Stack**
* **Frontend:** React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, HTML5/CSS3
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs
* **Database:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Docker, Postman

---

**🔭 Current Focus**
* **First Principles Learning:** Currently deconstructing how **WebSockets** handle real-time data flow for my uptime monitoring project.
* **Open Source:** Migrating CI/CD pipelines to GitHub Actions to understand automation workflows better.
* **System Design:** Moving beyond "making it work" to "making it scalable."
